The app provides a seamless and synchronized communication experience, enabling users to send messages, create and delete chats, update their profile picture and display name, and attach files to messages.
## About the Name 'Babble'

The name "Babble" reflects the concept of talking rapidly and continuously in a foolish, excited, or incomprehensible way. It also resonates with the playful nature of bubbles, which inspired the choice of logo for the website.

## Screens

### Login Screen
